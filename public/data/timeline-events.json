			"body": "The planetarium API featured an authorisation domain, and was able to create data on stars and store them in a MySQL database but with some issues around how Spring was working with relationships. Because my mind likes to run rampant sometimes, the scope was getting a little out of hand so I have put it away for right now so I can focus on something new. Possibly a post-course project or an ESO Alchemy app rewrite that I had been planning for a little while."

The idea was to give us an idea of the real day-to-day of a developer: completing tickets as part of a sprint, daily standup, merge conflicts and other fun stuff. We were now ready to move onto the post-course training which was entirely self-motivated, while also preparing for hopefully some future interviews."

At the time, I was skeptical as to what I would learn over the months, thinking I had a firm grasp on JavaScript and CSS, but I was very wrong. Over the intense 12 week program, I built many different small projects, and solidified and added to my pre-existing skills. I also learnt some new technologies such as (collaborative-focused) git, SCSS/Sass, various testing suites, TypeScript and NestJS. As well, I was able to revisit Java that I had learnt over a decade before, and extend that to learning the Spring Framework."

I had told my employer that I was studying web development and she asked if I would like to try and rebuild her business website. I was given access to the WordPress and much to my dismay, I felt at the time that I had very little power to properly apply my coding skills. The database being used was also a MS Access file so things were going to be difficult, if not impossible, to integrate. I convinced her to build from scratch with more of an online database, and things were going not too bad, but actual music work became much more critical for both of us so the project was halted indefinitely. The tech stack used in the end was MongoDB, Express and Embedded JavaScript.",

We took Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on udemy.com but despite my friend pulling out early, I persisted especially as I found JavaScript to be a much nicer language to begin learning the basics with. It was a full-stack program and I was able to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express and working with MongoDB/Mongoose. With the help of Colt, I was able to complete the course and create a YelpCamp website which unfortunately doesn't exist anywhere on the internet as this was before I had become acquainted with git."
