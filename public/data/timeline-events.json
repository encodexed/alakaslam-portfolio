We were now ready to move onto the post-course training which was entirely self-motivated, while also preparing for hopefully some future interviews.",

I also learnt some new technologies such as (collaborative-focused) git, SCSS/Sass, various testing suites, TypeScript and NestJS.

The database being used was also a MS Access file so things were going to be difficult, if not impossible, to integrate. I convinced her to build from scratch with more of an online database, and things were going not too bad, but actual music work became much more critical for both of us so the project was halted indefinitely. The tech stack used in the end was MongoDB, Express and Embedded JavaScript.",

It was a full-stack program and I was able to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express and working with MongoDB/Mongoose.
