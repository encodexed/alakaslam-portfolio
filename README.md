# My portfolio website - Live at [https://alakaslam.io](https://alakaslam.io)

## Requirements / Purpose

The purpose of this site is clear! I wanted to have a space where I :
- could display information about myself
- could display information about my projects
- could talk about how my programming journey is coming along and what I've been up to
- could display my contact details and let people get in touch with me about opportunities or questions

This project is a re-appropriation of the first project we wrote during the _nology tech bootcamp. It was originally written as a HTML/CSS-only introductory project to web development and was completed by the second week of our course. It also originally was presented on a single page and was not very dynamic or interactive. You can find the old project [here](https://github.com/encodexed/portfolio)

Potentially, this website will also become home to some of my favourite projects for hosting.

**Tech Stack:** HTML, TailwindCSS, ReactJS, NextJS
